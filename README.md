# Level Up

[My Notes](notes.md)

Level up is a web application designed to help users learn and master new skills. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to learn a new skill but just didn't know where to start? Have you ever worked so hard to learn something but just kept getting it wrong? Level up is the app for you! Level up allows you to chat with other users, share video links, ask for help, and offer suggestions to improve your skill set in a variety of categories!
